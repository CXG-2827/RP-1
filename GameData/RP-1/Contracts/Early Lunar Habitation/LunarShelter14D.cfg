	description = <b>Program: Crewed Lunar Habitation</b><br><br>Previous crewed lunar mission requirements were short in duration, no more than a few days.  Much longer stays will be required in order to one day place a permanent installation on the Moon.  This mission will conduct the first long-duration planetary habitat experiment to validate the technology for further afar crewed exploration in the future.<br><br>This mission can be completed in numerous ways.  Whether Apollo-style with a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, as a Lunar Direct mission with no orbiter, or by sending a separate presupply mission ahead of your crew, the choice is yours.  However, follow-on missions will require longer stays and larger crews, so plan accordingly.  A separate pre-supply mission is available should you choose to use that mission profile.

	synopsis = Land a crew of 2 on the Moon, stay for 14 days, then return them safely to Earth

	completedMessage = Congratulations! We have improved our lunar technology and successfully executed a two-week stay. This completes the first step of learning to live on the Moon.
